## Key Relationships

1. **School Hierarchy**

   - School → Boards → Grades → Sections
   - Each level has a one-to-many relationship with the next

2. **User Management**

   - Auth.users is the source of truth for user identities
   - Users table manages roles and school associations
   - Teachers and Students tables extend user information

3. **Teaching Assignments**
   - Teachers can be assigned to multiple section-subject combinations
   - Each assignment creates a unique teacher-section-subject relationship

## Indexes

1. **Primary Indexes**

   - All tables have UUID primary keys
   - Schools has a unique site_id

2. **Foreign Key Indexes**
   - boards_school_idx on boards(school_id)
   - grades_board_idx on grades(board_id)
   - sections_grade_idx on sections(grade_id)
   - subjects_board_idx on subjects(board_id)
   - teachers_school_idx on teachers(school_id)
   - students_school_idx on students(school_id)
   - students_section_idx on students(section_id)

## Data Integrity

1. **Unique Constraints**

   - School site_id
   - Board names within a school
   - Grade names within a board
   - Section names within a grade
   - Subject names within a board
   - Teacher-school combinations
   - Student-school combinations
   - Teacher-section-subject assignments

2. **Timestamps**
   - All tables include created_at
   - Schools table includes updated_at with trigger
